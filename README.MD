# F1 Race Predictor â€“  2025

A machine learning-based simulation tool that forecasts the finishing positions of drivers in a Formula 1 Grand Prix. The current model is configured to predict the results of the 2025 Austrian Grand Prix, using historical race data, current qualifying performance, and driver-specific trends from earlier in the season.

This project leverages the FastF1 API to access real-world F1 telemetry and results, and combines that with manually supplied qualifying data from 2025. The result is a flexible prediction pipeline that can adapt to new races, drivers, and seasons with minimal manual effort.

  - 2025 qualifying times
  - Past 4-race trends (qualifying consistency, finish average, DNF rate)
- Automatically adapts if used on a different target race/round
- Trained using a Gradient Boosting Regressor
